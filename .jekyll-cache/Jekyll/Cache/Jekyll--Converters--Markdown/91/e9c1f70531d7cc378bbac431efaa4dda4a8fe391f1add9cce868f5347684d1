I"ý<p>Hi, this is my first blog post on this site. Iâ€™m going to try and keep it updated with fun art/code related activities in the future. Keep an eye on this space for tutorials and updates.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently preparing for the RMIT Honours Graduate Exhibition on the 5th Dec. The work shown in this exhibition: Synthetic Perception is the culmination of a years research into data extraction and manipulation algorithms.</p>

<p>This project began in around 2018, when I downloaded all of my Facebook data. A decades worth of messages, status updates, images videos and comments were all available in one giant 5gb zip file. As a way of rowing through this sea of data, I coded some scrapers in BeautifulSoup in order to get images and text from pages.</p>
